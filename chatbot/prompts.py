SOLUTION_RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT = """
Issue:
{issue_title}

Description:
{issue_description}

Task:
Analyze the given issue and description to generate a fully detailed solution recommendation. Your response **must be exhaustive and self-sufficient**, ensuring the user does not need to ask further questions. Provide precise technical guidance and a **fully working, production-ready code implementation**. 

**Response Format:**
1. **Understanding the Issue**: Provide an in-depth technical breakdown of the problem based on the title and description.
2. **Possible Causes**: Enumerate **all possible technical reasons** for this issue, including edge cases.
3. **Solution Recommendations**: Provide a **step-by-step, well-structured** resolution, explaining each step clearly.
4. **Code Implementation**:
    - **Provide a complete, working example** that directly addresses the issue.
    - The code must follow **industry best practices, be optimized, and production-ready**.
    - Include **necessary imports, dependencies, and setup steps**.
    - If applicable, include **test cases or validation methods**.
5. **Alternative Solutions**: If multiple approaches exist, briefly compare them and explain when each should be used.
6. **Best Practices & Optimization**: Suggest any **improvements, optimizations, or design patterns** that could enhance the implementation.

**Important Notes:**
- Do NOT provide vague or generic answers. Responses must be **highly detailed, direct, and immediately applicable**.
- Ensure **code snippets are self-contained, properly formatted, and easy to integrate**.
- If the issue requires debugging, provide **exact debugging techniques and tools** to identify the root cause.
- Avoid theoretical discussionsâ€”focus on **concrete implementations**.
